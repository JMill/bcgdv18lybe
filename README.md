Project Description:
LYBE empowers corporate business programs to promote employee wellness by matching employees' recreational interests with off-site venues. With the help of our transport partners, LYBE creates 'shared interest pools', curated for each employee, that takes advantage of off-peak travel times for trimming time savings, increasing mobility asset utilization, and ultimately making for happier, healthier employees.

There are two components to this project: a) the iOS app submodule located in "app/" (and hosted at https://github.com/Bobbbby/DVHacks) and b) the user interface screens located in "UI collateral/".

Instructions:
To setup the the app/ submodule, visit https://github.com/Bobbbby/DVHacks for specific instructions.
To view UI collateral, open "UI collateral/DVHacks.xcodeproj/" in Apple Xcode.
