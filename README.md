Project Description:
LYBE empowers corporate business programs to promote employee wellness by matching employees' recreational interests with off-site venues. With the help of our transport partners, LYBE creates 'shared interest pools', curated for each employee, that takes advantage of off-peak travel times for trimming time savings, increasing mobility asset utilization, and ultimately making for happier, healthier employees.
